# edie-chatbot

## edieselfbot a quick run down

- edie selfbot is the selfbot version of edie there will soon be a python version but for now this will do the job
- edie is a chatbot that is designed to be used as a selfbot for discord meaning it will only work on a user account

# Install and Setup

- do not update the node_modules it is using a very old version of discord.js to run as a selfbot 
- Replace default values in config and run using ``node chatbot.js``
